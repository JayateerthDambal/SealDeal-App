# BigQuery and Conversational AI Integration

This document outlines the process of exporting your Firestore data to BigQuery and then building a conversational AI analyst using Vertex AI Search and Conversation. This will allow you to perform large-scale analytics on your deal data and interact with it in a conversational manner.

## Part 1: Exporting Firestore Data to BigQuery

To export your Firestore data to BigQuery, we will use the official "Export Collections to BigQuery" Firebase extension. This extension automatically streams your Firestore data to BigQuery in near real-time.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the Firebase Console:** Open your project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. **Install the Extension:**
    * In the left-hand menu, go to **Build > Extensions**.
    * Click on **Explore extensions**.
    * Search for **"Export Collections to BigQuery"** and select it.
    * Click **Install in project**.
3. **Configure the Extension:**
    * **Firestore collection path:** Specify the collection you want to export. For this project, you will likely want to export the `deals` collection. You may also want to export the `analysis` sub-collection.
    * **BigQuery dataset ID:**  Enter the ID of your BigQuery dataset. If you don't have one, create one in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
    * **BigQuery table ID:** Enter a name for the BigQuery table that will store your exported data (e.g., `deals_raw`).
    * **Transform function (optional):** You can write a Cloud Function to transform your data before it's written to BigQuery. For now, you can leave this blank.
4. **Deploy the Extension:** Click **Install extension**.

Once the extension is installed, any new documents added to your `deals` collection (and any changes to existing documents) will be automatically exported to your BigQuery table.

## Part 2: Building the Conversational AI Analyst

Now that your data is in BigQuery, you can use Vertex AI Search and Conversation to build a chatbot that can answer questions about your deal flow.

### Steps

1. **Go to the Vertex AI Console:** Open the [Vertex AI Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) in the Google Cloud Console.
2. **Create a New App:**
    * In the left-hand menu, under **"Apps"**, select **"Search & Conversation"**.
    * Click **"+ New App"**.
    * Select **"Search"** as the app type.
    * Give your app a name (e.g., "Deal Flow Analyst").
3. **Create a Data Store:**
    * You will be prompted to create a data store.
    * Select **"BigQuery"** as your data source.
    * Provide the BigQuery table URI in the format `projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/datasets/YOUR_DATASET_ID/tables/YOUR_TABLE_ID`.
    * Vertex AI will then start indexing your data. This may take some time depending on the size of your dataset.
4. **Test Your Chatbot:**
    * Once the data is indexed, you can use the **"Preview"** tab in the Vertex AI console to test your chatbot.
    * Ask questions like:
        * "How many deals are in the screening stage?"
        * "Show me all the deals from last week."
        * "What are the key risks for the deal named 'Project X'?"
5. **Integrate into Your Frontend:**
    * You can embed the chat widget directly into your React application.
    * In the **"Integrate"** tab of the Vertex AI console, you will find a `<dialogflow-messenger>` HTML snippet.
    * You can add this snippet to your `Dashboard.tsx` or another relevant component to make the chatbot available to your users.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create a powerful analytics and conversational AI solution for your AI Startup Analyst Platform. This will enable your users to gain deeper insights from their deal flow data and interact with it in a natural and intuitive way.
